# Max Min

Given an array A of size N of integers. Your task is to find the sum of minimum and maximum element in the array.


```
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {-2, 1, -4, 5, 3}
Output: 1

Explanation: min = -4, max =  5. Sum = -4 + 5 = 1
```
```
Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
A[] = {6,1,2,8,3,4,7,10,5}
Output: 9
```

## Your Task :

You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function MissingNumber() that takes array and N as input  parameters and returns the value of the missing number.
